# Web-Automation-Testing
Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to basic web automation testing using ID locators. This project serves as a practical exploration of automated testing techniques for web applications, focusing on the effective use of unique IDs assigned to elements in HTML.
In this repository, I focus on basic testing using ID locators. ID locators are a fundamental element in web automation testing, offering a reliable and efficient way to identify elements on a webpage. My test scripts demonstrate how to leverage ID locators to interact with various elements such as buttons, input fields, and dropdown menus.
Basic Web Automation Testing with ID Locators

Overview
In modern web development, the identification of elements on a webpage plays a crucial role in automated testing. By leveraging unique IDs assigned to elements, we can precisely locate and interact with them during test automation. This repository contains a collection of test scripts demonstrating how to utilize ID locators effectively for basic testing scenarios.

Key Features
Element Identification: Learn how to locate and interact with webpage elements using their unique IDs.
Test Scenarios: Explore common test scenarios such as form submission, button clicks, and text input validation.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across different web browsers by employing ID locators.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage situations where elements with specified IDs are not found.
Reporting: Generate concise reports to gain insights into test execution and results.
